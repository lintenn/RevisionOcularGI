# RevisionOcular
## Ocular Revision
Django-based web application to operate and manage customer ocular revisions.
We have used a MySQL database (by installing the mysqlclient module). The configuration for the connection is specified in the file settings.py.
## Running the Django project
The way to work with this project is by running a server offered by Django (by default it runs at 127.0.0.1:8000) to which we make requests to operate our website from a browser.
To execute it, from the project directory we write the command: python manage.py runserver
